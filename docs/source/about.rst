About awesome-safety-critical
=============================

The starting point for me to create this resource was my interest in
safety-critical software:

- What makes safety-critical software special compared to "normal" software.

- `What kind of special training do engineers working on mission-critical software receive? [closed] <https://github.com/stanislaw/awesome-safety-critical/blob/master/What_kind_of_special_training_do_engineer_working_on_mission-critical_software_receive%3F_-_Stack_Overflow.pdf>`_
  and
  `its followup on Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5iohue/what_kind_of_special_training_do_engineers>`__.
